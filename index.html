        <p>We make all the product from farm fresh vegetables</p>

<p>Eating out can be a very pleasurable experience. Having dinner with a friend, eating a romantic meal while on a date or celebrating some special event with a party at a restaurant are all things we enjoy doing. Even so, there are few people who eat out all the time and eating at home has many points in its favor. It is cheaper to eat at home. It is healthier to eat at home and it is usually much more comfortable. For me, there is no doubt that I prefer eating at home.</p>
<br>
<p> Firstly, eating at home is much less expensive than eating in a restaurant. Obviously, when we eat at home we do the preparation, cooking and serving of the food ourselves and, therefore, do not need to pay the labor costs of cook, waiter and other restaurant staff. Similarly, we have no other overheads to pay for such as restaurant rent and high utility bills. A further cost saving is that we shop for the ingredients of our home-cooked meals ourselves and can choose those which are cheaper in price.</p>

<p>The world’s gone a bit bananas about food. Sure, it’s always been important. But seems like in the  last few years, it’s become an obsession.
Every day there’s a new food show to watch. A new celebrity chef to follow. A new study to worry about.
Is it just us, or is every other post on Instagram a food pic? (The rest being celebrities, babies, dogs, and of course, celebrity baby dogs.)
We recently discovered that 1 in 3 Instagrammers are willing to let food go cold so they can get the perfect photo of it.*
That’s pretty weird.
But get this: more than half of them have posted food pics because they look good, and then discovered the food itself didn’t taste very good.
That’s really weird.
Could our recent obsession with food be distracting us from the best thing about it?
To us, taste is everything – it’s the reason Best Foods exists–everything we make is designed to make food taste better. After all, you’d never eat our products on their own (unless you’re that one guy in Delaware).
We don’t have anything against awesome food pics (we take awesome food pics ourselves). We just  believe the greatest pleasure you can get from food comes from how it tastes.
Because we’re on the side of food</p>
